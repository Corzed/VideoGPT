## Features :sparkles:
- **Script Generation**: Automatically generate engaging scripts for YouTube videos on a variety of topics.
- **Image Insertion**: Embed dynamic images within scripts using sophisticated AI models.
- **Voiceover Creation**: Convert text scripts to audio using Google's text-to-speech service.
- **Video Assembly**: Compile images and voiceovers into a complete video.

## Installation :gear:

Before you start, make sure Python is installed on your system. You can then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install openai gtts moviepy requests
```

## Usage :computer:

Here’s a quick guide on how to use the script generator:

1. **Initialize the script**: Set up your OpenAI API key and other preferences.
2. **Generate a script**: Provide a topic to generate a script discussing your chosen subject.
3. **Extract image prompts**: Identify and prepare images based on the script's prompts.
4. **Create the video**: Compile the images and voiceover into a final video file.

### Example:

```python
topic = "Blackholes"
num_images = 3
script = generate_script_with_image_prompts(topic)
print(script)
```
